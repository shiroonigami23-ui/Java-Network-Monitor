# Java Network Monitor

This repository contains a Java application designed to perform scheduled network latency checks to predefined target URLs and log the results to a file. The application is containerized using Docker.

## Project Structure
* `NetworkMonitor.java`: The main Java source code for the scheduled network monitoring.
* `Dockerfile`: Instructions for Docker to build and run the Java application.
* `README.md`: Project documentation.
* `network_log.txt`: (Generated at runtime) Stores the latency check results.

## How to Run with Docker

To run this application using Docker, follow these steps:

1.  **Ensure Docker is Installed:** Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shiroonigami23-ui/Java-Network-Monitor.git
    cd Java-Network-Monitor
    ```

3.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    Navigate to the project root directory (where `Dockerfile` is located) and build the Docker image. This command will compile the Java code and package it into an image named `java-network-monitor`.
    ```bash
    docker build -t java-network-monitor .
    ```

4.  **Run the Docker Container:**
    Run the application in a Docker container. The application will start performing latency checks every 10 seconds and log the output to `network_log.txt` inside the container.
    ```bash
    docker run java-network-monitor
    ```

5.  **Access Logs (Optional):**
    If you want to view the `network_log.txt` generated by the application, you can either:
    *   **During execution:** Check the console output of the `docker run` command.
    *   **After stopping the container (requires stopping it first or running interactively):** Copy the file from the container. First, find the container ID: `docker ps -a`. Then, copy the log file:
        ```bash
        docker cp <container_id>:/app/network_log.txt .
        ```

## Deployment Requirements

*   **Docker:** The primary deployment requirement is Docker itself, as the application is designed to run within a Docker container.
*   **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** The `Dockerfile` includes `openjdk:17-jdk-slim`, which provides the necessary JRE within the container. No separate JRE installation is needed on the host machine for running the Docker image.
*   **No `requirements.txt` or `package.json`:** Since this is a standalone Java application built with standard Java libraries and containerized with Docker, there is no need for Python's `requirements.txt` or Node.js's `package.json` files. All Java dependencies are typically managed through build tools like Maven or Gradle, or simply by ensuring the necessary `.jar` files are included (which in this simple case is just the compiled `.java` file and standard JDK libraries).
